Step 1: time complexity of O(n log n)
Step 2: time complexity of o(n)

Copying to a sorted bag would take O(n^2) time, which makes it inefficient with this data structure.

Disadvantage: The sorting does not occur in place.


An indexed loop is best for step one.
An interator loop is better for step two.
This is because for a tree, a size function is not necessarily a fast action, which would make index based loop inefficient.
